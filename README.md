# magnatagatune-convnet
Experiments with songs and convolutional neural networks.

A pet project for learning how to use TensorFlow and sating my interests in "deep" (relative to a college student laptop's processing powers) learning.

# Mission

We aim to build a CNN that will learn content-based features in the task of describing audio samples. Using the [MagnaTagATune dataset](http://mirg.city.ac.uk/codeapps/the-magnatagatune-dataset), we hope to train the CNN to predict the human-sourced annotations (tags) of several thousand musical samples.

We will then construct a web service to gauge musical compatibility for SoundCloud users, based on their likes.
