Experiments with songs and convolutional neural networks.

A pet project for learning how to use TensorFlow and sating my interests in "deep" (relative to a college student laptop's processing powers) learning.



### tl:dr;

We aim to build a CNN (and the surrounding data infrastructure) that will learn content-based features in the task of describing audio samples. Using a subset of the [Millon Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/), we hope to train the CNN to predict human-sourced [Last.fm tags](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm) of several thousand track samples sourced from [7digital](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/tasks-demos#preview).

We will then construct a web service to gauge musical compatibility for SoundCloud users, based on their likes.
